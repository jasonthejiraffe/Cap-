## Description

Need a high quality screenshot to share an interesting site? This app uses the ApiFlash API to take screenshots of a given website with a variety of parameters. First, you will sign up for an ApiFlash account and explore the query builder that allows you to test out queries. Then, you will try making a single static API call from your site. Finally, you will build an interface that allows you to get your own screenshots and insert them into the page.

### Dependencies

Node.js, Visual Studio Code
